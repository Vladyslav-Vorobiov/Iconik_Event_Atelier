# Iconik Event Atelier website

### Hi there! Here you may see created by me adaptive and responsive website for event atelier.

- The current project uses many dynamic components. Some are taken from bootstrap and some are handwritten JS classes.
- Configured Gulp for watching and updating scss files in real time and gathering them into one main css file + minify it.

### Stack:

- HTML
- Sass
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Gulp
